nupic.pyxx-mt
=============

This code allows you to access and use python code from a multithreaded C++ program. Its main purpose is to provide a temporary way to use the nupic library (https://github.com/numenta/nupic) from C++, until the official nupic.core (https://github.com/numenta/nupic.core) is extracted.
